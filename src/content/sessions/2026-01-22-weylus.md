title: "Turning a Tablet into a First-Class macOS Input & Annotation Device with Weylus"
description: "Modern developer workflows—live coding, architecture walkthroughs, debugging sessions, and remote pairing—often lack a precise, low-latency annotation layer. This session explores Weylus, an open-source, cross-platform screen mirroring and input forwarding tool, and demonstrates how to integrate a tablet as a native-feeling input device for macOS."

Rather than treating the tablet as a secondary display, we’ll treat it as a **bidirectional input surface**: pen, touch, and gestures mapped directly onto the macOS screen. The focus is on **system behavior, latency characteristics, input mapping, DPI scaling, and real-world developer workflows**.

### 1. Problem Definition (Developer Context)

* Why mouse + screen share is insufficient for:

  * Code walkthroughs
  * Architecture diagrams
  * Debug timelines
  * State-machine explanations
* Whiteboards vs digital annotation: trade-offs
* Requirements:

  * Low latency
  * Accurate pen input
  * Zero vendor lock-in

---

### 2. Weylus Internals & Architecture

* Weylus high-level architecture

  * Screen capture pipeline
  * WebRTC-based streaming
  * Input event forwarding
* Input abstraction:

  * Pen pressure
  * Touch vs mouse emulation
* Network model (local vs remote usage)
* Security considerations

---

### 3. macOS + Tablet Integration Deep Dive

* Weylus setup on macOS (permissions, capture APIs)
* Tablet-side client behavior
* DPI scaling, resolution, and coordinate mapping
* Latency sources and how to minimize them
* Comparing USB vs Wi-Fi connectivity

---

### 4. Developer-Centric Workflows (Live Demo)

* Live code annotation in:

  * VS Code / JetBrains IDEs
* Drawing execution paths directly over code
* System design walkthroughs using:

  * Excalidraw
  * Browser-based diagrams
* Debugging:

  * Annotating logs
  * Tracing async flows
  * Explaining race conditions visually

---

### 5. Integration Patterns

* Using Weylus with:

  * OBS for recorded tech content
  * Zoom / Meet for remote pairing
  * tmux + terminal-heavy workflows
* Pen shortcut mapping strategies
* Gesture ergonomics for long sessions

<!-- ---

### 6. Performance, Limitations & Trade-offs

* CPU and GPU impact on macOS
* Input lag benchmarks (practical, not synthetic)
* Known limitations:

  * Palm rejection
  * Multi-monitor setups
  * High-DPI displays
* When Weylus is *not* the right tool

---

### 7. Open-Source Advantage

* Why Weylus vs:

  * Sidecar
  * Proprietary screen tablets
* Inspectability, extensibility, and trust
* Ideas for extending Weylus (plugins, scripts)

---

### 8. Demo, Debugging & Q&A

* Live troubleshooting scenarios
* Common misconfigurations and fixes
* Audience Q&A -->
